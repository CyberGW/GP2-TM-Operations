# GP2-TM-Operations
This repository contains the GP 2 programs written to perform intersection and determinisation operations on Turing machines. Also included are the test files, and the program used to convert the GP 2 outputs into a form recognised by JFLAP.
All GP2 programs are fully commented.
The machines have been tested using JFLAP 5.0.

The files are provided as supplimentary material to my project 'Graph-based Transformation of Turing machines'.
